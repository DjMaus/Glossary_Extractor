### Planning Document: Workflow for User-Guided Sorting in Word and Export to Excel  

---

#### **Objective**  
Enable users to extract text from a PDF, organize the data manually in Word by highlighting and applying labels with a single click, and then export the labeled content to an Excel file with columns for different languages and descriptions.  

---

### **Workflow Overview**  

1. **PDF Extraction**  
   - Extract text from a PDF file (e.g., glossary terms) into a structured Word document.  
   - Separate Finnish terms, Swedish terms, and descriptions into individual sections for clarity.  

2. **User-Guided Labeling in Word**  
   - Provide a Word file with pre-defined styles for labeling text (e.g., *Finnish Term*, *Swedish Term*, *Description*).  
   - Users can highlight text and apply the appropriate style using Word's ribbon or shortcuts.  

3. **Process the Labeled Word File**  
   - Use Python to read the styled content from the Word file.  
   - Identify labeled text based on styles and organize it into categories.  

4. **Export to Excel**  
   - Map the labeled text to an Excel spreadsheet with columns for `Finnish Term`, `Swedish Term`, and `Description`.  
   - Save the final Excel file for further use or sharing.

### **Detailed Steps**  

#### **Step 1: PDF Extraction**  
**Goal**: Extract terms and organize them into a Word file.  

- **Input**: PDF file (e.g., `VNK_2023_17.pdf`).  
- **Process**:  
  - Extract text using `fitz` (PyMuPDF).  
  - Structure the text into sections with placeholders for Finnish, Swedish, and descriptions.  
  - Output a Word file.  
- **Output**: A Word document with placeholders for the extracted text.  

#### **Step 2: Prepare the Word Document for Labeling**  
**Goal**: Enable user-friendly labeling in Word.  

- **Define Styles**:  
  - Create a Word template with predefined styles (`Finnish Term`, `Swedish Term`, `Description`).  
  - Include clear instructions at the top of the document for users.  

- **User Task**:  
  - Highlight text in the Word file and apply styles using the Word ribbon or shortcuts.  
  - Save the edited Word file.  

#### **Step 3: Process Labeled Word File**  
**Goal**: Extract labeled text from the edited Word document.  

- **Input**: User-edited Word file.  
- **Process**:  
  - Use Python (`python-docx`) to identify text and its corresponding styles.  
  - Map each styled paragraph to its category (`Finnish Term`, `Swedish Term`, `Description`).  

#### **Step 4: Export to Excel**  
**Goal**: Organize labeled text into an Excel spreadsheet.  

- **Input**: Parsed labeled data.  
- **Process**:  
  - Use `openpyxl` to create an Excel file.  
  - Map categories (`Finnish Term`, `Swedish Term`, `Description`) to separate columns.  
- **Output**: An Excel file with structured content.

### **Deliverables**  

1. **Python Scripts**  
   - Script to extract PDF text and generate a Word file.  
   - Script to process labeled Word file and export to Excel.  

2. **Word Template**  
   - A Word file with pre-defined styles for labeling (`Finnish Term`, `Swedish Term`, `Description`).  

3. **Excel File**  
   - Final Excel output with sorted columns.
