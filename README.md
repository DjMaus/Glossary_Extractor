Bilingual Glossary Converter

This project extracts bilingual glossary content from a PDF file, converts it to a formatted Word document, and exports the structured content to an Excel file with labeled columns for "Finnish Term," "Swedish Term," and "Description."

Project Overview

1. Extract Text from PDF: 
   - Read each page of the PDF using the `PyMuPDF` library to capture text, preserving the glossaryâ€™s original formatting.
   
2. Convert to Word Document:
   - Using `python-docx`, write the extracted text to a Word document, with optional formatting for headings or specific terms as needed.

3. Export to Excel:
   - Parse the Word content and use `pandas` and `openpyxl` to populate an Excel file with labeled columns for "Finnish Term," "Swedish Term," and "Description."

Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pymupdf`, `python-docx`, `pandas`, `openpyxl`
